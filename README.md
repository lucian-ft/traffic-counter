# 🚦 Urban Traffic Counter: IoT & Ground Truth System

This project is a complete hardware and software solution designed to monitor, count, and analyze urban mobility (pedestrians and cyclists) using radio frequencies and manual calibration.

## 🧠 Why this project?
Automatically counting people on a sidewalk using a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth scanner is efficient, but it also captures noise (e.g., people in passing cars, residents in nearby buildings). 
To make the data scientifically accurate, we need a **Calibration Factor**. This system provides both: the automated hardware sensor and the software to establish the "ground truth".

## ⚙️ The System Architecture

The project consists of two main components working in parallel:

### 1. The Hardware: ESP32 Automated Sniffer
* **Device:** ESP32 Microcontroller.
* **How it works:** It uses Time-Division Multiplexing (switching every 5 seconds) to sniff the air for both **Wi-Fi** (Probe Requests) and **BLE** (Bluetooth Low Energy beacons) emitted by smartphones and wearables.
* **Cloud Integration:** Every 5 minutes, it connects to a router and uploads the unique device count to **ThingSpeak** for real-time charting.

### 2. The Software: Ground-Truth Web App
* **What it is:** A lightweight, GPS-enabled HTML/JS web application hosted directly on GitHub Pages.
* **How to use it:** A human observer stands in the field with a smartphone, opens the app, and manually taps buttons as pedestrians/cyclists pass by.
* **Features:**
  * 📍 **Live GPS Tracking:** Records the exact Latitude and Longitude of the observer.
  * ⬅️➡️ **Directional Data:** Logs whether the person was moving Left or Right.
  * 💾 **CSV Export:** Downloads a perfectly formatted `.csv` file with exact timestamps for each event.

## 📊 How to calculate the data
By downloading the automated data from ThingSpeak and comparing it with the `.csv` file generated by the Web App for the same time window, researchers can calculate the margin of error and apply a correction factor to the IoT sensor.
